## Hello, Привіт, Bonjour, Hujambo, and こんにちは!

Hi.  I'm <abbr title='pronouns: he/him/his'>William</abbr>.  I make stuff in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Ruby.  In my current day job I'm a medical billing nerd specialized in surgical coding and denial resolution.  In my spare time, I do random things with foreign and constructed languages, play a lot of video games, and drink a lot of coffee.

How to get in touch:

- Email: <waellison@gmail.com>
- LinkedIn: [/in/tnwae](https://linkedin.com/in/tnwae)
- GitHub: Well, you're here, aren't you? ;-)

I can speak English and French well enough to correspond with you but I'll find it significantly easier to discuss matters technical in English.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day.
