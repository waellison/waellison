## Hello, Привіт, Bonjour, Hujambo, and こんにちは!

I'm <abbr title='pronouns: he/him/his'>William</abbr>.  I make stuff in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and C++.  In my current day job I'm a medical billing nerd specialized in surgical coding and denial resolution.  In my spare time, I do random things with foreign and constructed languages, play a lot of video games, and drink a lot of coffee.

How to get in touch:

- Instagram: [@nobettershoulder](https://instagram.com/nobettershoulder)
- GitHub: Well, you're here, aren't you? ;-)

I can speak English and French well enough to correspond with you but I'll find it significantly easier to discuss matters technical in English.
