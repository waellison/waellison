## Hello, Привіт, Bonjour, Hujambo, and こんにちは!

I'm <abbr title='he/him/his'>William</abbr>.  I make stuff in Python, JavaScript, Swift, and C++.  In my current
day job I'm a medical billing nerd specialized in surgical coding and denial resolution.  In my spare time, I do
random things with foreign languages, play a lot of video games, and drink a lot of coffee.

How to get in touch:

- LinkedIn: [https://linkedin.com/in/tnwae](/in/tnwae)
- Email: <waellison@gmail.com>
- GitHub: Well, you're here, aren't you? ;-)

I can speak English and French well enough to correspond with you but I'll find it significantly easier to
discuss matters technical in English.
